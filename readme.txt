****************************************************************

This demo is designed to illustrate techniques for using ColdFusion, ExtJS,
Saki's Ext.ux.tree.RemoteTreePanel and Joe Celko's Nested Set tree
database model using an MS SQL Server 2008 database.

After installing and initializing the database, you will have a fully working
tree structure that supports all CRUD operations as well as drag and drop
reordering.

Please see index.html for complete details, installation instructions and
references for further information.
